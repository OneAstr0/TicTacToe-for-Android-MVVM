TicTacToe 2
Game rules: Tic-tac-toe with complication. There may be 3 crosses and 3 noughts on the field in total. Example: When a person puts 3 crosses and is going to put the 4th cross, the first cross he put will disappear, when he puts the 5th cross, the second one he put will disappear. You need to carefully monitor the order of your moves and calculate the opponent's moves in advance.
